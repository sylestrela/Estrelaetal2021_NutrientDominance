Data files and R scripts used to generate figures for Estrela et al (2021) Nutrient dominance governs the assembly of microbial communities in mixed nutrient environments.

The 16S rRNA sequencing abundance data and community OD are available at https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3bk3j9kj6 and can be found in the data/data_master folder.

Each script in the Rscripts/figs_generating folder generates:
- pdf file with plot (saved in Rplots folder);
- csv file with data figure (saved in data/data_figures folder).

Codes for the MiCRM and FBA simulations can be found at https://github.com/vilacelestin.
